Repository for project group Cynthia Breazeal course DA210A  at Malmoe University

### Directories:
- [Python code for Raspberry Pi 2](https://github.com/dwildmark/DA210A/tree/master/Pycharm "Python code for Raspberry Pi 2")
- [C code for Arduino Due Controller](https://github.com/dwildmark/DA210A/tree/master/Atmel%20Workspace "C code for Arduino Due")
- [C code for Arduino Nano Remote](https://github.com/dwildmark/DA210A/tree/master/Atmel%20Workspace/Nano_experimental)

> **Note:**
>
>The Python virtual environment used for this project is located at [/.virtualenvs](https://github.com/dwildmark/DA210A/tree/master/.virtualenvs) since a lot of the packages have to be built from source and it is very tedious work to do every time a new environment is set up.
